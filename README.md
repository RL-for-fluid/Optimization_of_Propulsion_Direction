# Optimization_of_Propulsion_Direction

This page is a repository for rainforcement learning for fluid control.   
Using these source codes you can reproduce the results of the section 3.2 in 
the paper,   
"Akira Kubo and Masaki Shimizu, Efficient reinforcement learning for fluid flow control, arXiv:2012.04138, 2020".     

If your environment is similar to ours, CentOS7 64bit and Anaconda3, you may quickly reproduce the result by running the notebook. 
Otherwise, preprepair "test.x" and "FFTW" suitable to your environment; 
make the excutive file "test.x" by using the Makefile and install the FFTW package in the directory "FFTW".
